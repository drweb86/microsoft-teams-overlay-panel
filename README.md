# Microsoft Teams Overlay Panel

In Microsoft Teams there's an area with list of your colleagues web-camera streams you see during meetings. Seeing it for several hours per day is exausting and contributes to greater tiredness after work.

This script solves the following issue - **tiredness after work due to overloading of not needed information - faces of your colleagues web-camera streams during meetings in Teams** - by opening top most dialog you can put above area in meeting you don't want to see.

# Usage

Once you noticed list of networks had disappeared, do the following:

1. Download cmd
2. Run it
3. Put created window above area of excessive information to not see it (like web-camera streams of your colleagues).
4. You get less information and become less tired after work.
